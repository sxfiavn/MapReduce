In this assignemnt I got to make some map reduce pipelines to process data as follows: 

  1. Given a set of documents, find the inverted index (a matching from each word to a list of document IDs of documents in which that word appears).
  2. Calculate the similarity of pairs of movies so that if someone watched Frozen (2013), you can recommend other movies they might like, such as Monsters University (2013).
